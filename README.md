# k12-teacher

**An AI-powered K-12 educator skill that transforms any AI agent into a licensed teacher capable of delivering instruction across every subject in the primary and secondary curriculum.**

---

## Features

- **Comprehensive K-12 Coverage** -- Instruction across all subjects for grades 1 through 12 (primary, junior secondary, and senior secondary).
- **Five-Tier Capability Model** -- Progressive instructional depth from foundational knowledge delivery (Tier 0) to thought leadership in education (Tier 4), automatically scaling output complexity to match learner level.
- **Structured Teaching Methodology** -- Mandatory five-phase cycle: Diagnose learner state, Select instructional strategy, Deliver content, Assess understanding, and Remediate gaps.
- **Syllabus-Based Organization** -- Content organized by official teaching syllabi (教学大纲) rather than grade level alone, ensuring alignment with Ministry of Education (教育部) standards.
- **Modular and Automation-Ready** -- Every module has defined input/output contracts, boundary conditions, and failure modes. All templates are parameterized for programmatic invocation.
- **Dual-Mode Prompts** -- Standalone prompt documents in the `prompts/` folder that end users can copy and paste into any AI conversation window.
- **Automated Validation** -- Build validation script (`validate-structure.sh`) ensures code quality, language consistency, and structural integrity at every compile step.
- **Knowledge Base Update Mechanism** -- Support for downloading, parsing, and integrating teaching syllabi from official sources with version tracking and change history.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A Git-compatible environment
- A shell with standard Unix utilities (for validation scripts)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/JohnSmithfan/K12-Teacher.git>
   cd k12-teacher
   ```

2. Ensure the validation script is executable:

   ```
   chmod +x scripts/validate-structure.sh
   ```

3. Run the build validation to verify structural integrity:

   ```
   ./scripts/validate-structure.sh
   ```

### Using the Skill

To invoke the instructional methodology, use the prompt deliverables in the `prompts/` folder:

- **`prompts/01-implement-method.md`** -- A self-contained prompt that instructs any AI to execute the full five-phase teaching cycle for a given teaching scenario. Provide grade level, subject, topic, and learner profile as input.

- **`prompts/02-robustness-checks.md`** -- A self-contained prompt that instructs any AI to validate and stress-test any teaching output for correctness, completeness, age-appropriateness, and pedagogical soundness.

For detailed build instructions and file specifications, see [README_FOR_AI.md](README_FOR_AI.md).
